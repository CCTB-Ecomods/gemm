1. Purpose

This model is designed to simulate several patterns across genetic, individual, population and (meta-)community levels.


2. Entities, state variable and scales

Individuals (plants or animals) are the basic entity in the model.
Each individual carries a diploid set of chromosomes, which in turn are comprised of genes.
Some of the genes code for on ore more traits (pleiotropy), while a trait can be dependent on more than one gene (polygene).
The realized trait value is the mean of the traits coded by maternal and paternal alleles.
Traits thus controlled encompass
the initial body mass (size) of offspring ("seedsize"),
the body mass determining onset of maturity and thus reproductive capability ("repsize"),
the groth rate ("growthrate"),
the probability for density-independent mortality ("ageprob"),
mean dispersal distance ("dispmean"),
the probability of dispersal ("dispprob"),
the shape of the dispersal kernel, controlling long-distance-dispersal ("dispshape"),
the probability and thus frequence of reproduction ("repprob"),
the radius in which an individual searches for a mate ("repradius"),
the mean number of offspring in a reproduction event (litter size,n "reprate"),
the threshold of sequence identity between mates determining genetic compatibility ("reptol"),
values representing the optimum and the tolerance (standard deviation) of a physical niche parameter ("tempopt", "temptol", resp.).
Alternatively to be controlled by mutable genes, these traits can also be set to fixed values.
Additionally, individuals carry attributes
