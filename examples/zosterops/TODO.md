# ZOSTEROPS TODO

## General

- [ ] read species & habitat descriptions of *Zosterops* & Taita Hills

- [ ] read up on current literature about evolutionary rescue, introgressive hybridization

- [ ] write F2 course report (about what exactly?)

## GeMM adaptation

- [ ] add `elevation`, `forest`, and `habitat` fields to `Patch`

- [ ] write a function to convert `elevation` to `temp`

- [ ] initialise two species
		- highland species *Z. silvanus* (Taita White-eye, a.k.a. subspecies of *Z. poliogaster*)
		- lowland species *Z. senegalensis* or *Z. abyssinicus*

- [ ] vary hybridization affinity for core experiment

- [ ] prepare map series for SLOSS experiment (constant habitat size)
		- single very large habitat
		- some large habitats
		- several small habitats

- [ ] measure & record:
		- degree of heterozygosity
		- genetic diversity
		- population sizes
		
## Notes

- do we need the `forest` variable?

- how should burn-in work?

- how do we design the SLOSS map series?
