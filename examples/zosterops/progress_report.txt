Hello everyone,

and welcome back from the holidays :-) I just wanted to give you all a brief update of where the Zosterops project is now, and what the next steps are going to be.

What has been done so far:

- We've discussed the model design and experimental setup for the Taita Hills "evolutionary rescue" study
- We've acquired the remote sensing data we need to construct the model map from Petri Pellikka
- I've written a script to translate this data into the model's plain-text map format
- I've done a thorough reorganisation of the model's code base, with a lot of refactoring and some performance optimisation
- I've implemented most of the new functionality we need to switch the model from a plant-community model to a bird-population one
- I've prepared an introductory presentation to the code base that we will talk about at next week's Ecomod meeting (14.1.)

What needs to be done next:

- The introduction mentioned above - get Charlotte and Robin up to speed on the source code
- Soon after, we ought to have a joint meeting with everyone to discuss how to proceed from here
- There are still a few open questions regarding Zosterops biology / experimental design that we need to settle to finish implementing the model logic
- Model output still needs to be adjusted to the new study questions
- Write analysis script for the new output data
- Figure out how to adjust the input maps for the SLOSS scenario
- Start simulation runs to find remaining bugs
- Run the actual experiment...

I would suggest the 18th or 19th of January as the date for our meeting. Let me know if that works for you.

All the best,
Daniel
