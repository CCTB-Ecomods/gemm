# Ideas for habitat scenarios

1. expand all habitats
   -> more area
   -> slightly better connectivity
   -> e.g. undisturbed natural regrowth

2. contract all habitats
   -> less area
   -> small habitats disappear
   -> worse connectivity
   -> e.g. deforestation for firewood

3. remove small habitats
   -> slightly less area
   -> worse connectivity
   -> e.g. clearing for agriculture

4. add small habitats
   -> slightly more area
   -> better connectivity
   -> e.g. small-scale conservation project

5. remove big habitat
   -> much less area
   -> worse connectivity
   -> e.g. industrial logging

6. add big habitat / expand big habitats
   -> much more area
   -> better connectivity (when adding)
   -> e.g. large-scale reforestation project
