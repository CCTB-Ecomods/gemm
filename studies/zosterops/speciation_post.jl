"""This script is intended to do the post processing part of our speciation study
The end goal is to be able to split the .fa files according to timestep using the inds file and
the seqs file. It automatically takes the first half of the genome and concatenates it into a
"chromosome" for further analysis.
These are then loaded into a further tool (eg. FasTree)

Input parameters are the foldername of the replicate in results
