"""This script is intended to do the post processing part of our speciation study
The end goal is to be able to split the .fa files according to timestep using the inds file and
the seqs file. 
Additional goal (will this be in this script, I don't know) is to recreate the individuals genetically
and try and cluster them into species.

Input parameters are the foldername of the replicate in results
