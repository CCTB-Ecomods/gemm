Overarching question:
=====================
The relative role of eco-evolutionary processes and genetic architecture for trait distributions and species richness on oceanic islands.



Main factors:
=============

linkage: from more phenotypic variation (more viable phenotypes) to more distinctive populations (less viable phenotypes).
tolerance: from distinctive populationsto more variation inside populations, outcrossing depression?
heterogeneity: from less species, large pops to more species, maybe unstable pops
complexity (intra-insular isolation): from... to more species/endemics (non-adaptive radiation), but also harder to rescue.
(dynamics)

Adressed 50 questions:
======================

    Q10. Is trait evolution fundamentally different on islands than on continents? [# 42; % = 64.9]

    Q11. How robust are the various island rules and syndromes relating to body size, loss of dispersal, colouration, breeding system, woodiness and clutch size, among others? [# 47; % = 63.3]

    Q12. To what extent are island populations genetically impoverished, compared to comparable mainland populations? [# 50; % = 62]

Q16. How can we best incorporate population genetic and/or phylogenetic data to advance models of island biogeography? [# 28; % = 68.3]

Q22. What functional traits (e.g. relating to dispersal capacity, reproduction, trophic ecology) are associated with high diversification rates within and across island systems? [# 2; % = 77.9]
