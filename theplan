Overarching question:
=====================
The relative role of eco-evolutionary and genetic architecture for trait distributions and species richness on oceanic islands.



Main factors:
=============

linkage: from more phenotypic variation (more viable phenotypes) to more distinctive populations (less viable phenotypes).
tolerance: from distinctive populationsto more variation inside populations, outcrossing depression?
heterogeneity: from less species, large pops to more species, maybe unstable pops
complexity (intra-insular isolation): from... to more species/endemics (non-adaptive radiation), but also harder to rescue.
