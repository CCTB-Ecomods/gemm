# Introduction

This is the documentation for the Island Speciation Model, a.k.a. Genetically
explicit Metacommunity Model (GeMM). *(Yeah, we're still working on the name...)*

The aim of this model is to create a virtual island ecosystem that can be used to
explore ecological and evolutionary hypotheses *in silico*. It is genetically
and spatially explicit, with discrete space and time.

This documentation is generated from the source code using Julia's inbuilt
`Documenter` module. It is sorted first by functionality, second by source code
file.
