# TODO Island invasion model

* start with adult individuals?
* create global species pool
* invade!() function
* create settings for:
	- propagule pressure
	- initial species pool
	- global species pool size
	- constants (from constants.jl)


# Notes

* Is it possible that there are vastly more individuals on a patch than its
	cellsize would allow?

* How much memory does one individual use? (Rough calculations suggest 20KB,
	this seems somewhat high...)
