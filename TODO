# TODO Island invasion model

* create global species pool
* invade!() function
* point-of-entry for invasion (on map)
* write log files and save to output dir
* create settings for:
	- propagule pressure
	- initial species pool
	- global species pool size
	- constants (from constants.jl)


# Notes

* Is it possible that there are vastly more individuals on a patch than its
	cellsize would allow?
